## Outcomes

> In this exercise, the process for signing and verifying commits is covered including:
>
> 1. Explicitly sign and verify commits
> 1. Troubleshooting problems
> 1. Optional Git configurations to sign and verify all commits

## Steps

1. **Confirm SSH commit signing is setup correctly**

   ```shell
   git commit -S --allow-empty --message="Confirm SSH commit signing setup"
   ```

   Possible results:

   - ```
     [main f425cff] Confirm SSH commit signing setup
     ```

     :partying_face: Congratulations!  SSH signing setup including SSH agent is good.

   - ```
     error: Load key "/var/folders/xb/svzskj1x77x3qsmwx1d84nqc0000gn/T//.git_signing_key_tmpW0EAyi": invalid format?
     ```

     :disappointed_relieved: Do not to worry!  This is error is likely due to:

     1. SSH agent being stopped
     1. SSH private key not being added
     1. mismatch between SSH private and public keys

     Try following the steps in https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

1. **Confirm SSH commit verification is setup correctly**

   ```shell
   git log --show-signature
   ```

   Possible results:

   - ```
     Good "git" signature for your_email@example.com with ED25519 key SHA256:...
     ```

     :partying_face: Congratulations!  SSH commit verifying setup including SSH agent is good.

   - ```
     error: gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile needs to be configured and exist for ssh signature verification
     ```

     :disappointed_relieved: Do not to worry!  This is error is likely due to missing `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` configuration above.

   - ```
     Good "git" signature with ED25519 key SHA256:...
     /path/to/.ssh/allowed_signers:1: invalid key^M
     sig_find_principals: sshsig_get_principal: key not found^M
     No principal matched.
     ```

     :disappointed_relieved: Do not to worry!  This is error is likely due to format of `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` file as SSH public keys cannot be copied as-is into the file.

1. **Configure additional SSH commit signing and verifying for workshop repository specifically:**

   ```shell
   git config commit.gpgsign true
   git config log.showSignature true
   ```

   > **Note**
   > To globally configure SSH signing and verifying, use the `--global` flag:
   >
   > ```shell
   > git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   > git config --global log.showSignature true
   > ```

   For more information about these Git configuration options, see `commit.gpgSign`[^man-git-config-commitgpgsign], `log.showSignature`[^man-git-config-logshowsignature].
