Due to the decentralized nature of Git, authenticity can only be established by [signing changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/signature-format#_overview), which involves capturing the additional `gpgsig` header information with `commit` or `tag` [Git objects][git-scm-internals-storage]:

```shell

## Broader security concerns

Our reliance on software and the increasingly complex ways that changes are authored have raised the need to secure our supply chains.

In the May 2021 White House "[Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity][whitehouse-improving-nations-cybersecurity]" executive order, enhancing software supply chain had a whole section devoted to establishing trust:

- `4.e.iii`

  > employing automated tools, or comparable processes, to maintain trusted source code supply chains, thereby ensuring the integrity of the code;

- `4.e.vi`

  > maintaining accurate and up-to-date data, provenance (i.e., origin) of software code or components, and controls on internal and third-party software components, tools, and services present in software development processes, and performing audits and enforcement of these controls on a recurring basis;

- `4.e.x`

  > ensuring and attesting, to the extent practicable, to the integrity and provenance of open source software used within any portion of a product.

Expanding existing signing support for [GPG][git-1.7.9-releasenotes] and [X509][git-2.19.0-releasenotes] signing, [Git 2.34][git-2.34-tidbits] added SSH signing support, which we hope lowers barriers to improving code authenticity.
